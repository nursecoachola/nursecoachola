- 👋 Hi, I’m @Olayinka Aremu
- 👀 I’m interested in hacking an idea in enhancing communication between nurses in the care transitioning of patients from hospital to the community and via a vis. Having worked in an acute hospital setting, ED, Stroke and Geriatrics ward and now I work in a nursing home. There’s so much gap in communication and lots of information and vital patients documents. Hoping to develop a care transition app to be used to make communication easier and effective
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my PhD on nurse to nurse care transition experiences of the older adults. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on digital resources ideas and information on how to birth this innovation and make it acceptable to the Irish community 
- 📫 How to reach me ...I am on Twitter as @nursecoachO and LinkedIn as Olayinka Aremu
